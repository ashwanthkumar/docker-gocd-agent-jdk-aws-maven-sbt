# Usage
To run this docker container use the following command
```
docker run -d ashwanthkumar/gocd-agent-jdk-aws:latest
```

# Environment variables
In order to configure the agent for use in your cluster with other than default settings you can pass in the following environment variables

| Name  |	Description |	Default value |
| --- | --- | --- |
| GO_SERVER |	The host name or ip address of the server to connect to	| localhost |
| GO_SERVER_PORT  |	The http port of the go server  |	8153  |
| AGENT_MEM |	The -Xms value for the java vm	|  128m  |
| AGENT_MAX_MEM	| The -Xmx value for the java vm  |	256m  |
| AGENT_KEY |	The secret key set on the server for auto-registration of the agent	| |
| AGENT_RESOURCES |	The resource tags for the agent in case of auto-registration  | |
| AGENT_ENVIRONMENTS  |	The environments the agent is assigned to in case of auto-registration  | |
| AGENT_HOSTNAME  |	The hostname used for the agent; normally it's the hosts actual hostname	|  |
| AGENT_GUID  | GUID of the agent; normally it is left blank and auto-generated by the server	|  |
| DOCKER_GID_ON_HOST  |	To mount docker socket and use it without sudo the go user needs to be added to the docker group; pass in the gid from the guest os with this variable  | |

To connect the agent to your server with other than default ip or hostname

```
docker run -d \
    -e "GO_SERVER=gocd.yourdomain.com" \
    ashwanthkumar/gocd-agent-jdk-aws:latest
```

If you've set up your server for autoregistration of agents pass in the same value for environment variable `AGENT_KEY` when starting the agent

```
docker run -d \
    -e "GO_SERVER=gocd.yourdomain.com" \
    -e "AGENT_KEY=388b633a88de126531afa41eff9aa69e" \
    ashwanthkumar/gocd-agent-jdk-aws:latest
```

You can also set resource tags, gocd environment and hostname for the agent when autoregistering

```
docker run -d \
    -e "GO_SERVER=gocd.yourdomain.com" \
    -e "AGENT_KEY=388b633a88de126531afa41eff9aa69e" \
    -e "AGENT_RESOURCES=deploy-x,deploy-z" \
    -e "AGENT_ENVIRONMENTS=Production" \
    -e "AGENT_HOSTNAME=deploy-agent-01" \
    ashwanthkumar/gocd-agent-jdk-aws:latest
```

To mount docker socket and be able to use it sudo-less inside the container use the following

```
docker run -d \
    -e "GO_SERVER=gocd.yourdomain.com" \
    -e "DOCKER_GID_ON_HOST=$(getent group docker | cut -d: -f3)" \
    -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
    -v /usr/bin/docker:/usr/bin/docker \
    ashwanthkumar/gocd-agent-jdk-aws:latest
```

Do be aware that mounting docker inside your container poses a large security risk as the container indirectly has access to the whole machine in this way.

# Mounting volumes
In order to keep working copies over a restart and use ssh keys from the host machine you can mount the following directories

| Directory |	Description |	Importance  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| /var/lib/go-agent/pipelines |	This directory holds the working copies for all pipelines that have run on this agent | You want to have this cleaned up regularly anyway, so no real need to mount it  |
| /var/log/go-agent |	All output logs go here, but there also written to standard out in the container  |	Preferably collect logs from standard out |
| /var/go/.ssh  |	The ssh keys to connect to version control systems like github and bitbucket  |	As it's better not to embed these keys in the container you likely need to mount this |
| /var/run/docker.sock  |	To mount the docker socket of the guest os  |	Note: mounting this is a security risk! |
| /usr/bin/docker |	To mount the docker binary of the guest os  |	Note: mounting this is a security risk! |

Start the container like this to mount the directories

```
docker run -d \
    -e "GO_SERVER=gocd.yourdomain.com" \
    -e "AGENT_KEY=388b633a88de126531afa41eff9aa69e" \
    -e "AGENT_RESOURCES=deploy-x,deploy-z" \
    -e "AGENT_ENVIRONMENTS=Production" \
    -e "AGENT_HOSTNAME=deploy-agent-01" \
    -v /mnt/persistent-disk/gocd-agent/pipelines:/var/lib/go-agent/pipelines
    -v /mnt/persistent-disk/gocd-agent/logs:/var/log/go-agent
    -v /mnt/persistent-disk/gocd-agent/ssh:/var/go/.ssh
    -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
    -v /usr/bin/docker:/usr/bin/docker \
    ashwanthkumar/gocd-agent-jdk-aws:latest
```

To make sure the process in the container can read and write to those directories create a user and group with same gid and uid on the host machine

```
groupadd -r -g 999 go
useradd -r -g go -u 999 go
```

And then change the owner of the host directories

```
chown -R go:go /mnt/persistent-disk/gocd-agent/pipelines
chown -R go:go /mnt/persistent-disk/gocd-agent/ssh
```
